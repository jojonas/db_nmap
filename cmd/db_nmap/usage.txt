Usage: {{.Name}} <nmap arguments>

{{.Name}} is a wrapper around Nmap that inserts hosts and services into a
Metasploit database right after the corresponding host group has been scanned.
It does so by reading Nmap's XML output and parsing it as a stream of hosts.
{{if ne .ConnString ""}}
The default database connection string defined at compile time is:
{{.ConnString}}
{{end}}
The default database settings can be overriden by specifying environment
variables such as PGHOST, PGPORT, PGUSER or PGPASSWORD. For a full list of
options, see:
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-envars.html

The destination workspace can be configured with the environment variable
{{.WorkspaceEnvVar}}. 

{{.Name}} was tested with Nmap versions: {{join .TestedVersions ", "}}
